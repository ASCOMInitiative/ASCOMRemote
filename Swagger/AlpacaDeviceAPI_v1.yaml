  title: ASCOM Alpaca Device API
  
  version: v1
  
  license:
    name: MIT
    url: https://opensource.org/license/mit

  description: >
    The Alpaca API uses RESTful techniques and TCP/IP to enable ASCOM applications and devices to communicate across modern network environments.


    ## Interface Versions

    These interface definitions include the updates introduced in **ASCOM Platform 7**.


    ## Interface Behaviour

    The ASCOM Interface behavioural requirements for Alpaca drivers are the same as for COM based drivers and are documented in the
    <a href="https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Developer/html/N_ASCOM_DeviceInterface.htm">API Interface Definitions</a> e.g.
    the <a href="https://ascom-standards.org/Help/Developer/html/M_ASCOM_DeviceInterface_ITelescopeV3_SlewToCoordinates.htm">Telescope.SlewToCoordinates</a> method.      
    This document focuses on how to use the ASCOM Interface standards in their RESTful Alpaca form.
    
    ## Try it out
    
    `April 2025` - The "Try it out" option has been removed from this online API definition becuase the experience was poor compared to
    using "Try it out" in the Omni-Simulators, which are installed as part of Platform 7. 
    
    You can view the Omni-Simulator's Alpaca API descriptions, including "Try it out", by starting the Omni-Simulators and clicking the "View Swagger docs and interactive queries" link on the home page.
    
    
    ## Alpaca URLs, Case Sensitivity, Parameters and Returned values

    **Alpaca Device API URLs** are of the form **http(s)://host:port/path** where path comprises **"/api/v1/"** followed by one of the method names below.
    e.g. for an Alpaca interface running on port 7843 of a device with IP address 192.168.1.89:
    
    * A telescope "Interface Version" method URL would be **http://192.168.1.89:7843/api/v1/telescope/0/interfaceversion**
        
    * A first focuser "Position" method URL would be  **http://192.168.1.89:7843/api/v1/focuser/0/position**
        
    * A second focuser "StepSize" method URL would be  **http://192.168.1.89:7843/api/v1/focuser/1/stepsize**

    * A rotator "Halt" method URL would be  **http://192.168.1.89:7843/api/v1/rotator/0/halt**
    
    
    
    URLs are case sensitive and all elements must be in lower case. This means that both the device type and command name must always be in lower case. Parameter names are not case sensitive, so clients and drivers should be prepared for parameter names to be supplied and returned with any casing. Parameter values can be in mixed case as required.
    
    
    For GET operations, parameters should be placed in the URL query string and for PUT operations they should be placed in the body of the message.


    Responses, as described below, are returned in JSON format and always include a common set of values including the client's transaction number, 
    the server's transaction number together with any error message and error number.

    If the transaction completes successfully, the ErrorMessage field will be an empty string and the ErrorNumber field will be zero.


    ## HTTP Status Codes and ASCOM Error codes

    The returned HTTP status code gives a high level view of whether the device understood the request and whether it attempted to process it.
    
    
    Under most circumstances the returned status will be `200`, indicating that the request was correctly formatted and that it was passed to the device's handler to execute.
    A `200` status does not necessarily mean that the operation completed as expected, without error, and you must always check the ErrorMessage and ErrorNumber fields to confirm
    whether the returned result is valid. The `200` status simply means that the transaction was successfully managed by the device's transaction management layer.
    
    
    An HTTP status code of `400` indicates that the device could not interpret the request e.g. an invalid device number or misspelt device type was supplied. Check the body of the response for a text error message.


    An HTTP status code of `500` indicates an unexpected error within the device from which it could not recover. Check the body of the response for a text error message.

    ## SetupDialog and Alpaca Device Configuration

    The SetupDialog method has been omitted from the Alpaca Device API because it presents a user interface rather than returning data. Alpaca device configuration is covered in the "ASCOM Alpaca Management API" specification, which can be selected through the drop-down box at the head of this page.

      summary: Invokes the named device-specific action. 
      description:  >-
        Actions and SupportedActions are a standardised means for drivers to extend functionality beyond the built-in capabilities of the ASCOM device interfaces.
        
        
        The key advantage of using Actions is that drivers can expose any device specific functionality required. The downside is that, in order to use these unique features, every application author would need to create bespoke code to present or exploit them.
        
        
        The Action parameter and return strings are deceptively simple, but can support transmission of arbitrarily complex data structures, for example through JSON encoding.
        
        
        This capability will be of primary value to:
         * bespoke software and hardware configurations where a single entity controls both the consuming application software and the hardware / driver environment
         * a group of application and device authors who want to quickly formulate and try out new interface capabilities without requiring an immediate change to the ASCOM device interface, which will take a lot longer than just agreeing a name, input parameters and a standard response for an Action command
        
        
        The list of Action commands supported by a driver can be discovered through the SupportedActions property.
        
        
        This method should return an error message and NotImplementedException error number (0x400) if the driver just implements the standard ASCOM device methods and has no bespoke, unique, functionality.
        
        
        A full description of this member's behaviour is provided here: [Action](https://ascom-standards.org/newdocs/camera.html#Camera.Action)". Please note that this member functions identically in all device interfaces.

        ## Alpaca Specific Detail
        
        
        Returns an array of 32bit integers containing the pixel values from the last exposure. This call can return either a 2 dimension (monochrome images) or 3 dimension (colour or multi-plane images) array 
        of size `NumX * NumY` or `NumX * NumY * NumPlanes`. Where applicable, the size of `NumPlanes` has to be determined by inspection of the returned array.


        Since 32bit integers are always returned by this call, the returned JSON `Type` value is always 2 (integer).


        When de-serialising to an object it is essential to know the array `Rank` beforehand so that the correct data class can be used. This can be achieved through a regular expression or by direct parsing 
        of the returned JSON string to extract the `Type` and `Rank` values before de-serialising.


        This regular expression accomplishes the extraction into two named groups `Type` and `Rank`, which can then be used to select the correct de-serialisation data class:


        `^*"Type":(?<Type>\d*),"Rank":(?<Rank>\d*)`


        When the `SensorType` is Monochrome, RGGB, CMYG, CMYG2 or LRGB, the serialised JSON array should have 2 dimensions. For example, the returned array should appear as below if `NumX = 7`, `NumY = 5` 
        and `Pxy` represents the pixel value at the zero based position `x` across and `y` down the image with the origin in the top left corner of the image.  


        Please note that this is "column-major" order (column changes most rapidly)
        from the image's row and column perspective, while, from the array's perspective, serialisation is actually effected in "row-major" order (rightmost index changes most rapidly). 
        This unintuitive outcome arises because the ASCOM Camera Interface specification defines the image column dimension as the rightmost array dimension.

        ]

        ```


        When the `SensorType` is Color, the serialised JSON array will have 3 dimensions. For example, the returned array should appear as below if `NumX = 7`, `NumY = 5` 
        and `Rxy`, `Gxy` and `Bxy` represent the red, green and blue pixel values at the zero based position x across and y down the image with the origin in the top left corner of the image.  Please see note above regarding element ordering.

        ## Performance

        Returning an image from an Alpaca device as a JSON array is very inefficient and can result in delays of 30 or more seconds while client and device process and send the huge JSON string over the network. 
        A new, much faster mechanic called ImageBytes - [Alpaca ImageBytes Concepts and Implementation](https://www.ascom-standards.org/Developer/AlpacaImageBytes.pdf) has been developed that sends data as a binary byte stream and can offer a 10 to 20 fold reduction in transfer time. 
        It is strongly recommended that Alpaca Cameras implement the ImageBytes mechanic as well as the JSON mechanic.
